Project Stack:

Backend: Supabase (including database, auth, and storage)
Data Fetching: Tanstack Query
Form Handling: React Hook Form, Zod
Styling: Tailwind CSS
General Guidelines:

No New Technologies: Do not introduce or suggest the use of Next.js, Prisma, or any other technologies not listed in the "Project Stack" section above.
Use Existing Libraries: Utilize the existing libraries and frameworks already in place (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn-ui, Supabase, React Router DOM, Tanstack Query, Zod, Axios, Date-fns).
Focus on Existing Code: Base your solutions on the existing codebase structure and patterns.
Supabase Only: All database interactions should be done directly with the Supabase client. Do not use any other ORM or database library.
React Components: Build UI elements as reusable React components.
TypeScript: Use TypeScript for all code.
Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
No Server-Side Rendering: This is a client-side rendered application. Do not implement server-side rendering.
Follow Existing Patterns: Adhere to the existing coding style, naming conventions, and directory structure.
Prioritize Existing Code: If a component or hook already exists, modify it instead of creating a new one.
