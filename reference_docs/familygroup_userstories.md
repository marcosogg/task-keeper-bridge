Okay, here's a high-level scope document for the family group feature, designed to give the development team a clear understanding of the big picture and the overall goals:

**High-Level Scope: Flexible Family Groups and Private Channels**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope for the implementation of flexible family groups and private communication channels within the TAZQ application. This feature is crucial for supporting diverse family structures and providing a more organized and private communication experience. The goal is to move beyond a single, unified family group model to a system that allows users to create and participate in multiple groups, with the ability to have private conversations within those groups.

**2. Goals**

*   **Flexibility:** Enable users to create and belong to multiple family groups, accommodating various family structures (e.g., divorced parents, multi-generational families).
*   **Organization:** Provide separate contexts for tasks, events, and messages for each family group.
*   **Privacy:** Allow users to create private communication channels within a family group for sensitive or specific conversations.
*   **Usability:** Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use for managing multiple family groups and private channels.

**3. Core Features (MVP Scope)**

*   **Multiple Family Groups:**
    *   Users can create new family groups with a name.
    *   Users can join existing family groups using an invitation code or by being added by an existing member.
    *   Users can switch between different family groups using a dropdown or menu in the header/sidebar.
*   **Separate Task Contexts:**
    *   Each family group has its own set of tasks, events, and messages.
    *   When creating a task or event, users must select the family group to which it belongs.
    *   The task list, event calendar, and messages are filtered based on the selected family group.
*   **Basic Private Channels:**
    *   Users can create private message channels with other members of their family group.
    *   Private channels are limited to direct messages between two users for the MVP.
    *   Messages in private channels are only visible to the members of that channel.
*   **Task Assignment:**
    *   Users can assign tasks to specific members within a family group.
    *   Tasks are associated with a `family_id` and `assigned_to` user.
*   **Basic UI for Group Management:**
    *   Users can create, join, and leave family groups.
    *   Users can manage the members of each family group they belong to.

**4. Out of Scope (for MVP)**

*   **Subgroups:** Subgroups within a family group are not included in the MVP.
*   **Advanced Private Channels:** Features like group private channels or more granular permissions are not included in the MVP.
*   **Complex Task Assignment:** More complex task assignment features (e.g., assigning to subgroups) are not included in the MVP.
*   **Advanced Notifications:** More complex notification settings and filtering are not included in the MVP.

**5. Technical Considerations**

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   The `families` table will remain as is.
    *   The `family_members` table will remain as is.
    *   The `tasks`, `events`, and `messages` tables will be updated to include a `family_id` column.
    *   New tables will be added for `channels` and `channel_members`.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   API endpoints will be updated to include the `family_id` and `channel_id` parameters.
    *   Authorization checks will be implemented to ensure users can only access data for groups and channels they are members of.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   A family selection dropdown/menu will be added to the header or sidebar.
    *   The task creation form will be updated to include a family selection.
    *   The messaging interface will be updated to be context-aware.
    *   The family management page will be updated to support multiple groups.
*   **Data Filtering:**
    *   Queries will be filtered by the currently selected `family_id` and `channel_id`.

**6. User Experience Considerations**

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should be able to easily switch between different family groups and private channels.
*   **Clear Visual Cues:** The UI should clearly indicate which family group or channel is currently selected.
*   **Context Awareness:** The application should be context-aware, displaying only the data relevant to the selected family group or channel.
*   **Feedback:** The application should provide clear feedback to users when they perform actions, such as creating a task or sending a message.

**7. Iterative Approach**

*   The implementation will be done in an iterative manner, focusing on core functionality first.
*   Each user story will be implemented, tested, and approved before moving on to the next.
*   User feedback will be gathered and incorporated into future iterations.

**8. Success Metrics**

*   Users can create and join multiple family groups.
*   Users can easily switch between different family groups.
*   Users can create tasks, events, and messages specific to each family group.
*   Users can create and use private message channels.
*   Users can manage their family groups and members.

This high-level scope document should provide the development team with a clear understanding of the goals, features, and technical considerations for the flexible family group feature. It also emphasizes the importance of an iterative approach and user feedback.


Understanding the Existing Codebase:

Before diving into implementation, I'd first review the relevant parts of the codebase to understand the existing structure and identify areas that need modification:

src/pages/auth/SignUp.tsx: This file handles user signup and will need to be modified to include the family group creation step.
src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx: This file manages user authentication state and will need to be updated to handle the new family group creation process.
src/components/family/CreateFamilyModal.tsx: This component already exists and handles the creation of a family group. It will need to be reviewed and potentially modified.
src/integrations/supabase/client.ts: This file contains the Supabase client setup and will be used to interact with the database.
src/integrations/supabase/types.ts: This file defines the types for the Supabase database, and will need to be updated if the schema changes.
src/hooks/queries/useFamilyMembers.ts: This hook fetches family members and will need to be updated to handle multiple family groups.
src/pages/Index.tsx: This is the dashboard page and will need to be updated to display data for the new family group.
src/services/api/family.ts: This file contains the API calls for family related operations.
Implementation Plan:

Database Schema Review:

Verify that the families and family_members tables in Supabase are correctly set up.
Ensure that the families table has columns for id, name, created_by, and created_at.
Ensure that the family_members table has columns for id, family_id, profile_id, role, status, joined_at, and created_at.
No schema changes are needed for this story.
Update SignUp.tsx:

Conditional Rendering: After successful user signup, conditionally render the CreateFamilyModal component.
Pass Props: Pass the necessary props to the CreateFamilyModal component to control its visibility and behavior.
Review CreateFamilyModal.tsx:

Form Handling: Ensure that the form submission logic correctly creates a new family group in the database.
Admin Member: Ensure that the user creating the family group is automatically added as an admin member in the family_members table.
Error Handling: Ensure that errors are handled gracefully and displayed to the user.
Success Handling: Ensure that the modal closes after successful creation and the user is redirected to the dashboard.
Loading State: Ensure that the loading state is correctly managed during the creation process.
Update AuthContext.tsx:

User State: Ensure that the user state is updated correctly after a new family group is created.
Session Handling: Ensure that the session is correctly handled after a new family group is created.
Loading State: Ensure that the loading state is correctly managed during the process.
Update useFamilyMembers.ts:

Query Logic: Update the query logic to fetch family members for the newly created family group.
Caching: Ensure that the data is cached correctly.
Update Index.tsx (Dashboard):

Data Fetching: Ensure that the dashboard fetches data for the newly created family group.
UI Updates: Ensure that the UI is updated to display data for the new family group.
Testing:

New User Signup: Test the signup flow to ensure that a new user can create a family group.
Admin Member: Verify that the user is added as an admin member of the new family group.
Dashboard Update: Verify that the dashboard is updated to display data for the new family group.
Error Handling: Verify that errors are handled gracefully.
Loading State: Verify that the loading state is correctly managed.

Key Points:

Incremental Implementation: This approach focuses on implementing the core functionality first, allowing for incremental testing and feedback.
Clear Responsibilities: Each step is clearly defined, making it easier for the development team to understand their tasks.
Testable Units: Each user story is testable, allowing for thorough verification of the implementation.
By following this approach, you can ensure that the core family group functionality is implemented correctly and efficiently, providing a solid foundation for future development. Let me know if you have any questions or want to refine this plan further.
